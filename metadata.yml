  io.kubewarden.policy.usage: |
    This policy validates the annotations of generic Kubernetes objects.

    The policy rejects all the resources that use one or more annotations on the deny list. The deny list is provided by at runtime via the policy configuration.

    The policy allows users to put constraints on specific annotations. The constraints are expressed as regular expression and are provided via the policy settings.

    The policy allows users to require specific labels to be part of the resource.
    The list of mandatory labels is provided at runtime via the policy configuration.

    The policy settings look like that:
    ```yaml
    # List of annotations that cannot be used
    denied_annotations:
    - foo
    - bar

    # List of annotations that must be defined
    mandatory_annotations:
    - cost-center

    # Annotations that are validate with user-defined RegExp
    # Failing to comply with the RegExp resuls in the object
    # being rejected
    constrained_annotations:
      priority: "[123]"
      cost-center: "^cc-\\d+$"
    ```

    **Note well:** the regular expression must be expressed using Go's syntax.
